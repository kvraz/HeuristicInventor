# HeuristicInventor
An automated discovery engine that uses Large Language Models to invent Python code for combinatorial optimization. Features an iterative "Novelty Search" loop where LLMs (Gemini/DeepSeek) generate, test, and improve TSP solvers by introducing new state variables and search dynamics.
